# **comp**
The `comp` relation is used for arguments of verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, auxiliaries, adpositions and conjunctions.

This relation is refined into several sub-relations:  [`comp:aux`](../comp_aux) (auxiliary argument), [`comp:cleft`](../comp_cleft) (cleft clauses), [`comp:obj`](../comp_obj) (direct object),[`comp:obl`](../comp_obl) (oblique argument), [`comp:pred`](../comp_pred) (predicative argument).

In virtually all cases, corpora are directly annotated with the sub-relations, rather than with the `comp` relation. However, `comp` may sometimes be used when one has difficulty deciding between `comp:obj` and `comp:obl`.
