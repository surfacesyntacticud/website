The `udep` relation is used for complements when one does not wish to or is unable to distinguish between arguments and modifiers. This relationship can notably be used in cases where the complement's relationship with its governor is ambiguous. When there is little debate about the nature of the relationship, the more specific label is preferred.

The governor and the dependent of a `udep` relation can have any POS. The `udep` relation is frequently given to the complements of nouns, since it is generally more difficult to distinguish between arguments and modifiers for nouns than it is for verbs. 

As shown in the [correspondences between SUD and UD](../../correspondences), the `udep` label is used while automatically converting an `obl` label from a UD annotation. This is because `obl` can correspond to both `comp:obl` and `mod` in SUD.
